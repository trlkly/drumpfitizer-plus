# Drumpfitizer Plus
A better way to "Make Donald Drumpf Again!"

This addon implements additional aspects that are missing from the original Drumpfinator addon (or its Firefox port). Additional features include

1. Changes page titles
2. Changes hover text.
3. Minimizes the flast of seeing Trump turn into Drumpf.
4. **Does not change text in text boxes** (so you won't accidentally say "Drumpf" when you need to say "Trump.")
5. Works faster (by using a TreeWalker).
6. Added a few extras (like catching many Twitter tags.)
7. Actively maintained.
